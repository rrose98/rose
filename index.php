<h1><b>Biography</b></h1>
</div>
<p><h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Remeticado, Ria Rose A. currently living in Cabiangon, Pinamungajan Cebu with my live-in partner Sasuta, Jufiel C.</h5></p> 
<p><h5>Taking up Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Technology(BSICT) at Cebu Technological University(CTU) Naga-Extension Campus.</h5></p>
<p><h5>I ride the bus everyday from home to school and the other way.</h5></p>
<p><h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a daughter at an early age of 17. Luckily my family took it easily and understand the situation.</h5></p>
<p><h5>My mother decided to let me live with my boyfriend for she has nothing she can do to make things right. So Jufiel's family let us live in their old house.</h5></p>
<p><h5>The house isn't big nor small, just enough for a small family which is normally composed of a maximum of 3 children. During the first month of stay, everything seemed normal.</h5></p>
<p><h5>It felt like we really are bound but then things seemed to go wrong, misunderstandings and problems started building such wall that love alone cannot conquer./h5>/p>
<p><h5>Trust had become the downfall of our relationship. So I decided to ask my parents to raise my child while I pursue my studies. My mother agreed to it, but when classes is fast approaching,</h5></p>
<p><h5>Jufiel decided to show. At first, I didn't plan to reconcile but when I saw how my daughter longed for her father. It took all my courage to push him away from us./h5></p>
<p><h5>Classes started, instead of continuing the course i had taken which is Bachelor of Technical Teaching Education (BTTE). I decided to take another course, Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Technology.</h5></p>
